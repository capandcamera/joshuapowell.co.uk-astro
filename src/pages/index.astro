                <p class="about">

                    Welcome!<br/><br/>
                    My name is Josh and Iâ€™m originally from South East London, currently residing in Kent. <br/><br/>

                    My love of photography began aged 20 when I bought my first Nikon camera, gradually moving onto a Samsung GX10, Pentax K70 and currently, my Sony A7RIV. <br/>

                    <br/>
                    I specialise in product photography and astrophotography. I love creating images that show others a different perspective of the world as well as discovering new products and putting my personal spin on them.
                    I also enjoy taking photos of Urban Landscapes, Seascapes and my dog Jinx (when she lets me!)

                    <br/><br/>
                    If you have any questions about the website or my work, please feel free to get in touch!
